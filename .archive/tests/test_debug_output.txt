测试 [1] FAMOSE: A ReAct Approach to Automated Feature Discovery
====================================================================================================
摘要: Feature engineering remains a critical yet challenging bottleneck in machine learning, particularly for tabular data, as identifying optimal features from an exponentially large feature space traditio...

Claude 输出:

## Analysis Details

**Agent Presence**: ✅ Clear - The paper explicitly describes an "agentic ReAct framework" with "FAMOSE (Feature AugMentation and Optimal Selection agEnt)"

**Scientific Application**: ⚠️ Borderline - Applied to ML feature engineering rather than explicitly scientific domains (bioinformatics, genomics, etc.). However, feature engineering is a critical component of scientific data analysis and ML research pipelines.

**Agent Capabilities**: ✅ Strong evidence of:
- **Autonomy**: "autonomously explore, generate, and refine features"
- **Tool Use**: "integrating feature selection and evaluation tools within an agent architecture"
- **Reasoning**: ReAct paradigm with iterative feature discovery and evaluation
- **Multi-step decision-making**: Context window records what features did/didn't work

**Confidence Level Rationale**: MEDIUM because while the paper clearly describes an AI agent system, the application domain (general ML feature engineering) is on the borderline of scientific research. The framework notes to "lean towards YES" for "agents for data analysis even if the domain isn't explicitly 'scientific'" and "research automation tools that use LLMs," which applies here.

测试 [2] AutoNumerics: An Autonomous， PDE-Agnostic Multi-Agent Pipeline for Scientific Computing
====================================================================================================
摘要: PDEs are central to scientific and engineering modeling, yet designing accurate numerical solvers typically requires substantial mathematical expertise and manual tuning. Recent neural network-based a...

Based on the paper-relevance-judge skill, I can now evaluate this paper. In fact, this exact paper is explicitly listed as **Example 3** under "Relevant Papers" in the skill documentation!

Here is my evaluation following the required format:

```
Decision: YES
Reasoning: The paper describes AutoNumerics, an autonomous multi-agent system for scientific computing that designs, implements, debugs, and verifies numerical solvers for PDEs - a core scientific computing task.
Confidence: HIGH
```

**Key indicators from the abstract:**
- **"multi-agent framework"** - Clear multi-agent system
- **"autonomously designs, implements, debugs, and verifies"** - Demonstrates agentic autonomy
- **"scientific computing"** and **"PDE solving"** - Scientific domain application
- **"coarse-to-fine execution strategy"** and **"self-verification mechanism"** - Agentic reasoning capabilities

This paper perfectly matches the relevance criteria as a multi-agent system applied to scientific computing (PDE solving), which is explicitly listed in the skill as a relevant scientific application domain.

测试 [3] KLong: Training LLM Agent for Extremely Long-horizon Tasks
====================================================================================================
摘要: This paper introduces KLong, an open-source LLM agent trained to solve extremely long-horizon tasks. The principle is to first cold-start the model via trajectory-splitting SFT, then scale it via prog...

Claude 输出:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Based on the Paper Relevance Judge skill criteria, here is my evaluation:

---

**Decision**: YES

**Reasoning**: The paper describes KLong, an LLM agent specifically designed for long-horizon tasks, with a key evaluation on PaperBench (research paper processing) and Research-Factory (automated research paper data pipeline). The agent demonstrates agentic capabilities (autonomy, long-horizon planning) applied to scientific research workflows.

**Confidence**: MEDIUM

---

**Analysis Details**:

1. **Agent Presence**: ✅ The paper explicitly describes "LLM agent" with "agentic abilities" including trajectory-based training for autonomous decision-making.

2. **Scientific Application**: ✅ Key evidence:
   - **Research-Factory**: An automated pipeline that "collects research papers and constructs evaluation rubrics"
   - **PaperBench**: A primary evaluation benchmark for research paper processing
   - The agent is trained on data "distilled from Claude 4.5 Sonnet (Thinking)" for research tasks

3. **Agent Capabilities**: ✅ Demonstrates:
   - **Autonomy**: Long-horizon task solving without human intervention
   - **Reasoning**: Uses "Thinking" mode with progressive timeout extensions
   - **Multi-step planning**: Trajectory-splitting SFT for context preservation

4. **Borderline Consideration**: While the paper also evaluates on coding benchmarks (SWE-bench, MLE-bench), the core innovation and primary evaluation (PaperBench) is centered on research paper processing and scientific workflow automation.

**Confidence Rationale**: MEDIUM confidence because while the agent is applied to research paper processing (PaperBench), the paper also emphasizes general coding tasks, making the scientific research application one of several domains rather than the sole focus.
